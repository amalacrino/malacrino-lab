The lab is growing!
* Uvini Senanayaka officially joined the lab as PhD student – welcome Uvini! She will work on understanding the interactions within the plant holobiont.
* Alexa Bennett officially joined the group as postdoc – welcome Alexa! She will work on metagenomics and pangenomics datasets to understand the rules behind plant microbiomes assembly and the consequences for plants.

We have two new preprints showcasing:
* Giusy's work: [Fire limits soil microbial dispersal and differentially impacts bacterial and fungal communities](https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.05.02.651892). 
* Edda's work: [Beneficial fungi are major drivers of root fungal microbiome assembly and network robustness](https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.04.27.650865).
