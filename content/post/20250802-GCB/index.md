New publication out in *Global Change Biology*!

What happens to life belowground after a fire? Our latest study uncovers how fire reshapes microbial communities in the soil — with consequences for ecosystem recovery worldwide.

Our global synthesis reveals that fire doesn’t just burn what’s aboveground — it fundamentally reshapes the invisible microbial world beneath our feet. By analyzing over 2,600 soil samples across 19 studies, here’s what we found:

* Fire disrupts how soil microbes disperse, limiting their ability to recolonize burned areas
* Fungal communities lose diversity, and bacterial communities shift toward fewer, dominant species
* This selects for pyrophilic specialists, altering how soil systems may function post-fire

These belowground shifts may reduce microbial resilience and slow down post-fire ecosystem recovery — especially as fire regimes intensify with global changes.
