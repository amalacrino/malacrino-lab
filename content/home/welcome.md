ðŸ‘‹ Hi, there! Welcome to the Malacrino Lab!
{style="font-size: 1.2rem; background: #FFB76B; background: linear-gradient(to right, #FFB76B 0%, #FFA73D 30%, #FF7C00 60%, #FF7F04 100%); -webkit-background-clip: text; -webkit-text-fill-color: transparent;"}


The **Malacrino Lab** at Clemson University focuses on fundamental and applied research on microbiomes, and their influence on host ecology and evolution. 

We integrate multiple approaches and theories spanning the fields of microbiology, community ecology, experimental evolution, meta-omics, and bioinformatics. In our quest to uncover the mechanisms and consequences of plant-microbe interactions, we aim to build a diverse and inclusive research group, welcoming great ideas and promoting tolerance and mutual respect.

We are currently based at the University of Reggio Calabria (Italy), but in January 2025 we will move to Clemson University (SC, USA).
