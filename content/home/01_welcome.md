The **Malacrino Lab** will open its doors in January 2025 as part of the [Department of Biological Sciences](https://www.clemson.edu/science/academics/departments/biosci/index.html) at Clemson University. The lab focuses on fundamental and applied research on microbiomes. 

Our research is a blend of theory drawn from evolutionary biology, community ecology, and multitrophic interactions, combined with cutting-edge tools in molecular biology, experimental evolution, high-throughput sequencing, and high-performance computing to delve deep into the mechanisms governing the interplay between hosts and their microbiomes. Our goal is to answer important fundamental questions: how do microbiomes influence host ecology and evolution? Which are the rules behind the assembly of microbial communities? Can we assemble/evolve microbiomes to drive changes in host traits? We mostly focus on soil, plants and their herbivores.

In our quest to uncover the mechanisms and consequences of host-microbiome interactions, we aim to build a diverse and inclusive research group, welcoming great ideas and promoting tolerance and mutual respect.
