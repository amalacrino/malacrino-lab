abstract: Herbivores are generally considered to reduce plant fitness. However, as in natural communities they often feed on several competing plant species, herbivores can also increase plant fitness by reducing interspecific competition among plants. In this study, we developed a testable model to predict plant fitness in the presence of an interspecific competitor and a herbivore that feeds on both plant species. Our model allows prediction of the herbivore and competitor densities at which the focal species will benefit from herbivory. This can be estimated by quantifying the effects of the herbivore on the fitness of the focal plant and on its competitor, and by estimating the levels of intra- and interspecific competition in a pairwise fashion, respectively. We subsequently validated the model in indoor microcosms using three interacting species: an aquatic macrophyte (the giant duckweed Spirodela polyrhiza), its native competitors (green algae) and its native herbivore (the pond snail Lymnaea stagnalis). Additional outdoor mesocosm experiments supported our model under natural conditions. Together, this study provides a conceptual framework to understand how herbivores shape plant fitness in a community context.
