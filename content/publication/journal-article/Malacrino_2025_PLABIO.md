abstract: Plant individuals within a species can differ markedly in their leaf chemical composition, forming so-called chemotypes. Little is known about whether such differences impact the microbial communities associated with leaves and how different environmental conditions may shape these relationships. We used Tanacetum vulgare as a model plant to study the impacts of maternal effects, leaf terpenoid chemotype, and the environment on the leaf bacterial community by growing plant clones in the field and a greenhouse. We hypothesized that all three factors affect the bacterial community of the leaves and that terpenoid and bacterial profiles as well as chemodiversity and microbial diversity are correlated. The results revealed that the leaf microbial community was significantly influenced by plant maternal effects and environmental conditions (field vs. greenhouse), but not by the leaf terpenoid profile. There was also no evidence for a correlation between terpenoid profiles and bacterial community composition and diversity. Overall, a higher number of unique amplicon sequence variants were found in the leaves of clones grown under field conditions than in those grown in the greenhouse. We also identified interactions between individual terpenoids and specific members of the leaf bacterial community. Our study suggests that terpenoid chemodiversity has, overall, little effect on the leaf bacterial community, but some terpenoids might affect specific beneficial species. While more studies are needed to investigate the relationship between plant chemodiversity and plant microbiomes, our results highlight the importance of integrating plant maternal effects, chemodiversity, and environment in understanding plant–microbiome interactions.
