We study how microbes influence plant interactions with insects, from pollinators to herbivores, and how insects in turn shape plant microbiomes.

Plants live in a complex web of interactions involving both helpful and harmful organisms. Microbes can affect how plants grow, but they can also influence how plants interact with insects—like pollinators, herbivores, or disease vectors. This project examines the three-way relationship between plants, their microbiomes, and the insects they encounter.

We study how changes in a plant’s microbiome affect its attractiveness to insects, its ability to resist pests, or its success in being pollinated. Conversely, we also look at how insect activity can reshape plant microbiomes by introducing or spreading microbes across plants.

These interactions are crucial for agriculture and ecosystem health. By better understanding the plant–microbe–insect triangle, we can develop smarter pest management strategies and support pollinator health, while making use of beneficial microbes already present in the environment.
