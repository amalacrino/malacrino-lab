We examine how plant-associated microbes can act as drivers of plant evolution by affecting survival and reproduction over generations.

Plants and microbes have been evolving together for millions of years. Just like pollinators or herbivores, microbes can influence which plant traits are favored over generations. In this project, we study how microbial communities drive the evolution of plants, from root structure to disease resistance and beyond.

We conduct experiments to see how different microbial communities affect plant fitness across multiple generations. This helps us understand whether and how microbes can act as agents of natural selection, shaping the evolution of plant traits in real time.

By viewing plant evolution through a microbial lens, we gain a more complete picture of how plants adapt to their environments. This work also has practical implications: if microbes influence how plants evolve, they could be harnessed to guide the development of more robust and adaptable crops.
