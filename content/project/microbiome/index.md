We investigate the ecological and environmental factors that govern how microbial communities assembly on plants.

Why do certain microbes live with some plants and not others? What determines which microbes arrive first, and how do they interact over time? These are the kinds of questions we ask when studying microbiome assemblyâ€”the process through which microbial communities assembly on a plant.

Our research investigates the ecological and evolutionary "rules" that shape microbiomes. We look at how factors like plant species, soil, climate, and even chance events influence the microbes that end up living on a plant. We also study how these communities change over time and respond to environmental disturbances.

By uncovering the principles that govern microbiome assembly, we can better predict and eventually manipulate microbial communities to benefit plants. This knowledge is essential for designing microbiome-based agricultural interventions that are effective, reliable, and grounded in ecological understanding.
