We study how plant genetic differences influence the composition and function of their associated microbial communities.

Plants don’t grow alone—they interact constantly with an invisible community of microbes living in and around their roots, leaves, and stems. These microbes can help plants grow better, resist disease, and tolerate stressful environments. But not all plants host the same microbes. One reason is the plant’s genome, which acts like a set of instructions that can influence which microbes are invited to stay and which are kept out.

Our research explores how plant genetics shape the makeup of the microbial communities that live on them. We compare different plant species and varieties to understand how subtle changes in their DNA lead to big changes in their microbiomes. By identifying the genes involved in these interactions, we can start to uncover the molecular “dialogue” between plants and their microbial partners.

Understanding these relationships can help us develop crops that naturally support healthier, more beneficial microbiomes. In turn, this could reduce the need for chemical fertilizers or pesticides, making agriculture more sustainable and resilient to climate change.
