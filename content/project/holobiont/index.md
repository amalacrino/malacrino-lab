Plants can recruit beneficial microorganisms from the environment to help them cope with stressors, but the genetic basis of such interactions is still poorly known. 

<!–more–>

In this framework, I aim to fill this knowledge gap in the field by understanding the plant genetic architecture that regulates the recruitment of beneficial microorganisms. The outcome of this project is particularly relevant as it has the potential to directly improve agriculture sustainability by (i) identifying markers for breeding varieties that can best use their microbiome, reducing the necessity of chemical inputs; (ii) designing synthetic microbial communities that can be used in the field instead of synthetic chemicals.
